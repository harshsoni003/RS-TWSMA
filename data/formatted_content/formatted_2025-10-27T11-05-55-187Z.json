      "headline": "Agentic OS",
      "content": "Cognitive-aware foundation managing AI agents. Think semantic context, process queues, neural resource mgmt. Turn AI from apps to learning systems."
    },
    {
      "headline": "Ontological Queues",
      "content": "Forget simple \"ready\" queues. AOS uses cognitive context. Learning, reasoning, routine, collab all get prioritized differently. Think smarter, not just faster."
